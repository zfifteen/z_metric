### Abstract

The Z Universal Form represents a foundational framework for unifying measured phenomena across physical, mathematical, and spatiotemporal domains. This formalism posits a universal expression that encapsulates dynamic relationships between observables, their derivatives, and fundamental limits, drawing on axiomatic principles to bridge classical geometry, number theory, and relativistic coordinates.

### Definition

**Universal Form**

$$ Z = A \left( \frac{B}{C} \right) $$

- $ A $: Measured quantity, representing any observable entity or magnitude in a given system, such as mass, energy, or information density.
- $ B $: Rate of change of $ A $, denoting the derivative or temporal/spatial evolution of the measured quantity, e.g., velocity as the rate of change of position.
- $ C $: Invariant universal limit of $ A $, an unchanging bound or constant that constrains the system's behavior, such as the speed of light in relativity or a maximal entropy in thermodynamics.

This form encapsulates a normalized ratio, where the product of $ A $ and the fractional rate $ B/C $ yields a dimensionless or dimensionally consistent $ Z $, interpretable as a unified metric.

### Axioms

1. **Z is Pythagorean**: $ Z $ adheres to Pythagorean relations in multidimensional spaces. Formally, for a vector decomposition of $ Z $ in an $ n $-dimensional metric space, $ Z^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n Z_i^2 $, implying orthogonality and hypotenuse-like aggregation of components. This axiom establishes $ Z $ as a geometric invariant under rotations, akin to Euclidean norms extended to hyperbolic or Minkowski spaces.

2. **A prime number is defined as a right angle in a Z**: Prime numbers emerge as angular constructs within the Z framework. A prime $ p $ corresponds to a right angle ( $ \pi/2 $ radians) in the phase space of $ Z $, where divisibility is analogous to collinearity. Formally, if $ Z $ forms a right-angled triangle with legs representing composite factors, a prime induces an irreducible orthogonality, preventing decomposition beyond unity. This redefines primality geometrically: $ p $ is prime if it spans a 90-degree rotation in the Argand plane representation of $ Z $, with no intermediate divisors aligning sub-angles.

3. **Z is a spacetime coordinate**: $ Z $ functions as a coordinate in a 4-dimensional spacetime manifold, integrating spatial dimensions with time. In Lorentzian geometry, $ Z = (ct, x, y, z) $ or its transformed equivalents, where the Universal Form governs transformations under boosts or rotations. This axiom posits $ Z $ as covariant, with $ A $ as the proper value, $ B $ as the four-velocity component, and $ C $ as the light cone limit.

### Derivations and Implications

To illustrate the formalism, consider applications in physics and mathematics:

- **Relativistic Kinematics**: Let $ A = m $ (rest mass), $ B = v $ (velocity), $ C = c $ (speed of light). Then $ Z = m (v/c) $, yielding relativistic momentum $ p = \gamma m v \approx m (v/c) $ in the non-relativistic limit, but extensible via Lorentz factors to preserve invariance.

- **Number Theory Integration**: For primes, visualize $ Z $ as a complex number $ Z = A e^{i \theta} $, where $ \theta = \pi/2 $ for primes, enforcing unique factorization via angular irreducibility.

- **Spacetime Metrics**: The Pythagorean axiom implies $ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 $, with $ Z $ as the interval.

For closed-ended derivations, such as computing $ Z $ for a specific case:

Example: Compute $ Z $ for position $ A = x $, velocity $ B = dx/dt $, limit $ C = c $.

Solution: $ Z = x ( (dx/dt) / c ) = (x / c) (dx/dt) $.

Step-by-step: (1) Identify components per definition. (2) Substitute into form. (3) Simplify, noting units yield time-normalized displacement.

This formalism invites extensions to quantum domains, where $ C $ may represent Planck constants, fostering interdisciplinary unification.

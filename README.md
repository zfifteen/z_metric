# üß≠ Z-Metric: A Relativistic Temporal Classifier on the Integer Manifold

This repository presents a novel framework for prime classification by reinterpreting the number line as a discrete spacetime lattice. The core construct, termed the **Z-metric**, defines a relativistic distance function over integers based on their prime factorizations. This metric is not merely a mathematical abstraction‚Äîit functions as a **temporal transformer**, correcting for arithmetic curvature in a manner analogous to time dilation in Minkowski spacetime.

The classifier implemented here navigates this curved integer manifold deterministically, identifying prime numbers by tracing geodesic-like paths through a structured metric space. It avoids explicit factorization by leveraging the intrinsic geometry of the number line, treating it as a four-dimensional spacetime construct with embedded curvature.

## üìê Conceptual Foundations

In classical number theory, the number line is treated as a flat, one-dimensional structure. This project reimagines it as a **discrete manifold** endowed with a non-Euclidean metric derived from prime decomposition. Each integer is a point in a curved space, where the curvature reflects its multiplicative complexity.

The **Z-metric** is defined as:

\[
Z = A\left(\frac{B}{C}\right)
\]

This formulation maps directly onto the relativistic time transformation:

\[
Z = T\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is a scaling factor
- \( B/C \) represents structural distortion due to factor density
- \( T(v/c) \) is the Lorentzian time dilation factor from special relativity

Thus, the Z-metric serves as a **temporal correction operator**, normalizing integer behavior relative to a fixed computational frame‚Äîanalogous to how relativistic observers reconcile proper time and coordinate time.

## üß™ Computational Implementation

The classifier operates deterministically, applying the Z-metric to traverse the integer manifold and isolate prime numbers. It performs the following:

- Constructs a Z-metric space over integers up to a specified bound
- Applies a hybrid filtering algorithm that avoids explicit factorization
- Validates accuracy and performance against known prime distributions

## üß≠ Physical Interpretation

The classifier navigates a **spacetime-like lattice** of integers, where:

- **Primes** behave as inertial reference points‚Äîminimal curvature, geodesically isolated
- **Composites** exhibit gravitational distortion‚Äîmetric deviation due to factor density
- **Filtering** corresponds to identifying geodesic paths that avoid curvature anomalies

This analogy is functional: the classifier succeeds precisely because it treats the number line as a relativistic manifold, where metric structure governs traversal and classification.

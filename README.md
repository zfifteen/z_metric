# **🔮 Z-Metric: A Universal Frame Shift Corrector**

This repository contains the proof-of-concept for the **Z-Metric framework** and the **Numberspace Conjecture**. It presents a novel method for analyzing discrete domains by treating observable patterns (like the prime number distribution) not as random, but as relativistic artifacts of linear observation.  
The core of this work is a universally applicable system for modeling and correcting these "observational frame shifts." The primary implementation, src/main/main.py, applies this framework to efficiently classify prime numbers.

### **Key Concepts**

* **The Numberspace Conjecture:** Posits that all discrete domains (integers, financial data, etc.) possess a holistic, interconnected structure. The patterns we see are emergent properties based on how we observe this structure.  
* **The Universal Frame Shift (UFS):** The act of linear, sequential observation (e.g., an algorithm iterating n \+= 1\) creates a relativistic discrepancy between the observer's frame of reference and the true, instantaneous state of the system.  
* **The Z-Transformation:** A set of equations that acts as a universal correction filter for the UFS. It transforms reference-frame-dependent data into invariant structures, much like Lorentz transformations in physics.

### **How It Works: The Hybrid Filter**

The main.py script demonstrates the theory in practice with a **Hybrid Filter** for primality testing. It does not test numbers in isolation but uses the Z-Metric to perform a dynamic, path-dependent analysis.

1. **Z-Metrics Calculation:** For each number, it calculates metrics based on a physics analogy:  
   * number\_mass: The number of divisors, analogous to rest mass.  
   * spacetime\_metric: The natural logarithm, representing the domain's fabric.  
   * z\_curvature & z\_resonance: Derived metrics that quantify the interaction between mass and spacetime.  
2. **The Observer:** Instead of a simple check, the classify\_with\_z\_score function analyzes the "geodesic path" from the last known prime to the current candidate.  
3. **The Adaptive Lens:** The filter's tolerance is not fixed. It uses a sigma\_multiplier that is dynamically calibrated by the candidate number's own "mass," creating a self-referential feedback loop.  
4. **The Oracle:** A high-certainty Miller-Rabin test (is\_prime) is used only when the low-cost Z-filter cannot confidently classify a candidate, conserving computational energy.

### **Axiom I: The Axiom of Domain Curvature**

This axiom establishes the fundamental principle of the Z-Metric framework, defining the relationship between an entity's intrinsic complexity and the structure of the domain it inhabits.

#### **1\. Definitions**

Let D be a discrete, ordered domain, such as the set of positive integers Z+.  
For any entity n∈D:

* Let d(n):D→R be the **Mass Function**, a measure of the intrinsic complexity or structure of n. For D=Z+, this is defined as the divisor function, σ0​(n).  
* Let λ(n):D→R be the **Spacetime Metric Function**, a measure of the local scale or magnitude of the domain at the position of n. For D=Z+, this is defined as the natural logarithm, ln(n).  
* Let Zκ​(n):D→R be the **Curvature Function**, a measure of the local distortion, or curvature, of the domain D induced by the entity n.

#### **2\. Axiomatic Statement**

The local curvature induced by an entity within its domain is directly proportional to the product of the entity's intrinsic mass and the local spacetime metric.  
This is expressed as:  
Zκ​(n)∝d(n)⋅λ(n)

#### **3\. Specific Formulation for the Domain of Integers (Z+)**

Within the Z-Metric framework as implemented, the constant of proportionality is defined as 1/e2, where e is Euler's number. The axiom is thus formulated as the precise equation:  
Zκ​(n)=e2d(n)⋅ln(n)​

#### **4\. Corollary: The Principle of Minimal Curvature**

A direct consequence of this axiom is that entities with minimal intrinsic mass induce minimal curvature in the domain. For the domain of integers, prime numbers (p) have a minimal non-trivial mass of d(p)=2. Therefore, primes represent points of minimal, stable curvature, acting as the fundamental geodesics of the Numberspace.

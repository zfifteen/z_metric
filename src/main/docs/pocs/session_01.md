## Relativistic Effects

1. **Time Dilation in Moving Frames**

Description: Show how time (A) stretches as velocity (B) approaches the speed of light (C) in a 3D spacetime grid, highlighting the invariant \(Z = \gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}\).

Script Outline:

- Use NumPy to build a 3D grid of spacetime points \((x,y,t)\).
- Scale the \(t\)-axis by \(\gamma\) based on a user-controlled velocity \(v\).
- Plot original and dilated worldlines as 3D lines in Matplotlib.
- Add an interactive slider for \(v\) to animate the stretching of the time axis.

Value: Animating the worldline elongation makes the Lorentz factor’s hyperbolic scaling tangible, reinforcing why moving clocks “tick slower.”

2. **Length Contraction Along Motion Axis**

Description: Demonstrate how spatial dimensions shrink along the motion direction, using \(Z = L_0/\gamma\) to visualize anisotropic scaling in 3D.

Script Outline:

- Define a 3D rod oriented along the \(x\)-axis with endpoints at \(\pm L_0/2\).
- Compute contracted length \(L = L_0/\gamma\) for a chosen \(v\).
- Transform rod coordinates and plot both original and contracted rods.
- Rotate the 3D view to emphasize contraction solely along the motion axis.

Value: Overlaying the two rods highlights directional contraction, giving an intuitive view of how moving frames warp lengths.

3. **Relativistic Aberration of Light**

Description: Illustrate how incoming light vectors shift direction in a moving frame via \(Z = \theta'(v/c)\), where \(\theta'\) follows the aberration formula.

Script Outline:

- Generate a hemisphere of incoming light unit vectors aimed at the origin.
- For each vector, compute the aberrated direction using  
  \(\cos\theta' = \frac{\cos\theta + v/c}{1 + (v/c)\cos\theta}\).
- Plot both original and aberrated rays as 3D scatter points with line segments.
- Animate the transformation as \(v\) ramps from 0 to near \(c\).

Value: The shifting scatter illustrates how a fast-moving observer “sees” light bent into a forward cone, turning formula into geometry.

## Universal Form Transformations

4. **Wave Packet Dispersion Under Z-Scaling**

Description: Visualize how a Gaussian wave packet spreads over time with dispersion rate (B) governed by medium parameter (C), using \(Z = \Delta x(t)/\Delta x(0)\).

Script Outline:

- Initialize a 3D Gaussian packet in NumPy.
- Compute its width \(\Delta x(t)\) analytically or via Fourier transform.
- Scale the packet’s spread using the \(Z\) factor at each timestep.
- Render an animated 3D surface or iso-surface in Matplotlib.

Value: Watching the packet broaden under different dispersion regimes makes continuous Z-scaling concrete and visually intuitive.

5. **Lorentz Boost on 3D Coordinates**

Description: Apply a universal Lorentz transformation to shift a 3D lattice of spacetime points by velocity \(v\), embedding \(\gamma\) into spatial axes.

Script Outline:

- Generate a 3D lattice of points \((x,y,z)\) at \(t=0\).
- Select a boost velocity \(v\) along one axis and compute new \((t',x')\).
- Plot both original and boosted lattices in overlaid 3D axes.
- Incorporate an interactive control to vary \(v\) and update the grid.

Value: Overlaid point clouds reveal how spatial axes shear and contract under boosts, turning abstract invariance into a direct 3D comparison.

6. **Curved Spacetime Around a Mass**

Description: Model the embedding of a 2D spacetime slice around a mass, with Z representing normalized geodesic deviation from flatness.

Script Outline:

- Define a 2D polar mesh \((r,\phi)\).
- Compute embedding depth \(z(r)\) for a Schwarzschild–like funnel.
- Plot the 3D surface using Matplotlib’s `plot_surface`.
- Numerically integrate geodesics on that surface and overlay their paths.

Value: Viewing the funnel shape and overlaid geodesics makes the concept of mass-induced curvature and frame-dependent paths unmistakably clear.

7. **Frame Dragging in Rotating Systems**

Description: Simulate inertial frame dragging around a rotating mass, with \(Z = \omega(r)/\omega_0\) dictating angular shifts at radius \(r\).

Script Outline:

- Construct a 3D grid around a central axis.
- Compute local dragging rate \(\Omega(r)\propto 1/r^3\).
- Plot vector arrows via Matplotlib’s `quiver`, twisted by the Z factor.
- Animate tracer particles moving along the dragged field lines.

Value: The twisted vector field reveals how rotation “drags” local frames, making Lense-Thirring effects vivid in 3D.

## Discrete & Analytical Domains

8. **3D Prime Lattice Under Z-Metric Curvature**

Description: Visualize integer points in a 3D lattice colored by a Z-metric (e.g., divisor count over \(\log n\)) to expose curvature-like clustering of primes.

Script Outline:

- Build a NumPy array of integer triples \((i,j,k)\).
- Compute \(Z(n)=d(n)/\ln(n)\) for each \(n\) mapped from \((i,j,k)\).
- Color-code points by their \(Z\) value and plot a 3D scatter.
- Rotate view to reveal sheet-like clusters where primes concentrate.

Value: The color gradients and clustering surfaces spotlight prime patterns as geometric “folds,” turning number-theoretic metrics into spatial intuition.

9. **DNA Vibrational Manifold Visualization**

Description: Map three principal DNA vibrational modes into a 3D manifold, scaling each axis by amplitude ratios \(A/B\) and frequency normalization \(C\).

Script Outline:

- Simulate or load vibrational frequencies/amplitudes for DNA segments.
- Select three dominant modes as \(x\), \(y\), \(z\) axes.
- Scale coordinates by amplitude ratios and normalize by max frequency.
- Plot points or mesh in Matplotlib and animate parameter sweeps.

Value: The resulting shape shows how mode clusters and separations evolve, offering geometric insight into vibrational resonances relevant for wave-guided therapeutics.

10. **Zeta Surface and Prime Distribution Dynamics**

Description: Render \(|\zeta(\sigma+it)|\) over the critical strip as a 3D surface, using \(Z = |\zeta|/Z_{\max}\) to highlight peaks tied to prime gaps.

Script Outline:

- Sample the Riemann zeta function on a grid of \(\sigma\in[0,1]\), \(t\in[t_{\min},t_{\max}]\).
- Compute normalized surface height \(Z(\sigma,t)\).
- Plot the surface in Matplotlib with contour overlays at known zeros.
- Animate the surface as \(t\) window shifts to show dynamic ridge movement.

Value: Peaks and valleys on the surface correlate with prime distribution features, converting deep analytic behavior into a tangible geometric landscape.
